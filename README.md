# Mapping ODA-funded research and innovation

## Background
This work aims to collate information on UK Official Development Assistance (ODA) research and innovation across all government funders and externals partners in a single place. 
Stakeholders should be able to view funded R&I by country, organisation and funder.

R scripts are used to extract and process data, either shared directly by funders or extracted from funders' public data repositories. Data on funded awards is then visualised in public
Tableau and Power BI dashboards.

## Repo contents

**Dashboard 1 - IATI_API_research_extract.R** - extracts all UK government funded ODA research and innovation activities from published IATI data.

**Dashboard 2 (part 1)- ODA RI awards.R** and **Dashboard 2 (part 2)- IATI partner activities.R** - extracts ODA award data from public repositories (UKRI Gateway to Research, 
NIHR Open Data, IATI repository), processes and collates it to output to a Google Sheet.

## Data visualisations

Output from the two scripts above feed two visualisations of ODA funded research & innovation:

*Dashboard 1: (Power BI)

*Dashboard 2: Funded ODA R&I awards by country:
